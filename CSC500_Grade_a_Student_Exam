# This program grades an exam by comparing the answers in a student’s text file to the items in a list containing the answer key. 
# I made two text files to test it with: one control file that matches the answer key 100%, and one that I generated by repeating the same arbitrary combination of ABCD until I had 20 letters. 
# Testing with the control file illuminated a need to remove any characters that didn’t correspond to a test answer before grading—which might not be necessary in a real-world grading scenario, 
# but I followed “better safe than sorry” reasoning.
# The program assumes that each of the 20 questions is worth five points. It outputs “+5 points” for each correct answer and “0 points” for each incorrect answer, 
# then prints both the final grade and a message that tells the student whether they passed the exam. 

#Creates a list containing the answer key
answer_key = list('ACAADBCACBADCADCBBDA')

#Reads the student's answers from a text file into a list
student_file = open(input('Hello! What file would you like to grade? '), 'r')
answers = list(student_file.read())

#We only want to grade answers, so we're going to strip out any extra characters (such as \n or numbering) that might have been in the student's answer file.
