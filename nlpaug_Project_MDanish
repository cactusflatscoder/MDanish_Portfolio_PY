# This script t takes a sample sentence from a text file in the same directory the script is in and expands the data in it by generating 10 alternate phrasings. 
# It uses the nlpaug libraryâ€™s SynonymAug method to perform the augmentations. nlpaug can also be used to simulate typos, augment with antonyms and random words, 
# and perform lists of augmentations in sequence in addition to other forms of text and audio augmentation.
